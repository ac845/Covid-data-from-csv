Project 1: Data Visualization of Covid analysis with csv file

In this project, you will be working with a CSV file that contains data about the Covid-19 cases in a certain region. The CSV file will have columns for the date, the number of new cases, the number of deaths, and the number of recovered cases. 

Your task is to read the data from the CSV file and create a dictionary for each day, with the date as the key and the other data as values. Then, you will create a list of these dictionaries. 

You will then use this data to calculate and print the total number of cases, deaths, and recoveries. You will also calculate the average number of new cases per day. 

Finally, you will use the random module to select a random day from the data and print the data for that day.

Estimated time to complete: 60 minutes

Step 1: Import the necessary modules
```python
import csv
import copy
import random
```
Step 2: Define your dictionary template
Step 3: Open the CSV file and read the data
Step 4: Calculate and print the total number of cases, deaths, and recoveries
Step 5: Calculate the average number of new cases per day
Step 6: Select a random day from the data and print the data for that day
